Microservice is to separate Bib-Bib project into small app 

Each service = small app (module,package,src)

- DockerFile is a configto create Docker image


Component for Microservice
Docker container = good for almost all project sizes
Microservice = good for big companies with a lot of code and people
Sweetspot = Monolith app and database in containers

1. Network in Docker container
   With networks it is possible to specific which containers can talk to each other
   If no network is specified, all containers are in the same network,
   containers in the same one can reference each other by name of service  "http://videos"

1. In container, it is do not guarantee to get localhost (127.0.0.1)
   /src/config/index.js
    let DB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/microservices"       //mean to to this database in mongodb

2. Every service should have following  for debugging purpose 
    app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
        res.json({msg:"book"})
    })

3. Every service has the same port = 3000

4. Make npm_module for common code such as model of mongo db 
   (how to create node_module)

5. app.get("/api/v1/search",async (req,res)=>{})
   better to crete api version just in case 

6. Try not to run synchronous so much , it is slow, and just use Promise.all

7. res.json (videos.concat(books))  => good concat 

8. Do not chain microservice.   microservice => database   better to direct connect to database (one hop rule)

9. fetch("http://videos:3000") //video declare as service name in docker-compose.yml

10. Better to user messageQ (kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ) between services  

11. We not allow client to directly connect or to see backend ipaddress, it must be connect via nginx

12. nginx is a gate way, for filter, firewall , load balance, cache , 

13. client can only go to hostname and /something 

14. Make sure when make axios or fetch , make it via nginx, not directly to application
    host_name = nanogram.io      , axios.get("http:nanogram.io/api/v1/video")    => not to "http://videos:3000

15. Meaning of
    location /{
        try_files $uri $uri/ @web        //if client send http://nanogram.io / ==> $uri = /  
    }                                    //it will look for "index.html" in root 
                                         //if client send http://nanogram.io/foo.html / ==> uri=foo.html
                                         //it will look in to root, but it can not be found 
                                         //at last it will look in location @web{} 
    location @web{
        proxy_pass http://web:3000      
    }                                       

16. MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb://db/microservices
    db = name of service of mongo
    microservices = name of database in mongo

How to change docker CLI to dockercompose
#docker run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bradtraversy/jekyll-serve

services:
    jekyll:
        image: bradtraversy/jekell-serve
        volume:
            - .:/site
        port:
            - '80:4000'

How to change host name in docker
#docker run -it -h test.local ubunty bash  //mean hostname to be http://test
